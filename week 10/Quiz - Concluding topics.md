# Concluding topics

## 1. In this course we have made an approach to audio signal processing mainly based on
* a spectral view of audio signals

## 2. The signal processing techniques covered in the course are of use to many applications, but we have focused on
* sound transformations and sound and music description

## 3. To process and understand sound and music signals
* we should complement signal processing techniques with methodologies coming from other disciplines

## 4. Vocaloid is
* a singing voice synthesizer developed by Yamaha in collaboration with the MTG

## 5. Dunya is
* a web platform developed at the MTG to explore music collections

## 6. AcousticBrainz is
* an initiative to collect and share data extracted from music recordings

## 7. The Reactable is
* a musical instrument based on a table top interaction technology

## 8. ICMC is
* the pioneer conference dedicated to computer music

## 9. smcnetwork.org is
* a web portal dedicated to sound and music computing

## 10. Machine learning and semantic analysis are fields
* that can complement the field of audio signal processing in analysis of music signals
