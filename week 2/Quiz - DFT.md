# DFT

## 1. In the DFT equation, the output signal X[k] is
* a complex function expressing the spectrum of the input signal x[n]

## 2. How many complex exponentials are computed and used in the DFT equation?
* as many as the samples of the input signal x

## 3. If the input signal of the DFT, x[n] of size N, is equal to one of the complex exponentials of the DFT equation, the output X[k] will be
* a value of N at the location k corresponding to the frequency of the complex exponential

## 4. If the input signal of the DFT, x[n], is one sinusoid with a frequency different from any of the frequencies of the DFT complex sinusoids, the output X[k] will be
* a complex function with values different from 0 for most of k

## 5. An input signal x[n] of size N=8 that is a real sinusoid with exactly 2 periods and amplitude 1 will create an output signal X[k] with the following values
* [0,0,4,0,0,0,4,0]

## 6. Given a spectrum X = [4,0,0,0], (these correspond to frequency samples from k=0 to k=3) when we compute its inverse Fourier transfrom we will obtain a signal x that is
* a constant value array x = [1,1,1,1]

## 7. A tuning fork produces a sound that is
* quite close to a sinusoid

## 8. Freesound is a website that
* hosts sounds that have been uploaded with a Creative Commons license

## 9. What is the difference between the spectrum of a real sinusoid from the spectrum of a complex sinusoid, being both of the same frequency?
* the spectrum of a complex sinusoid has only one peak, while the one of a real sinusoid has two peaks

## 10. The output of the DFT is a complex function from which we can measure
* the magnitudes and phases of the sinusoids present on the input signal
