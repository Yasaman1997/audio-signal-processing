# Harmonic model

## 1. What is the difference between the harmonic model and the sinusoidal model?
* the harmonic model assumes that all the sinusoids are multiples of a fundamental frequency

## 2. What is the difference between a sinusoid and a partial?
* a sinusoid is a mathematical function and a partial is a term used to describe a component of a sound that behaves like a sinusoid

## 3. To detect a harmonic in the frequency domain we consider that a harmonic is
* a stable spectral peak with a frequency that is an integer multiple of the fundamental frequency

## 4. To synthesize the harmonics of a sound, once we have obtained their magnitude, frequency and phase for the whole duration of the sound, we
* synthesize them as time-varying sinusoids, like in the sinusoidal model

## 5. The time domain techniques used to detect the fundamental frequency of a sound
* only work well with monophonic signals

## 6. The autocorrelation function of a discrete signal
* measures the similarity between the samples as function of the time lag between them

## 7. The YIN algorithm can be used to
* identify the fundamental frequency in monophonic signals

## 8. The F0 in the frequency domain can be defined as
* the greatest common divisor of the harmonic series that best explains the spectral peaks

## 9. The two-way mismatch algorithm is based on measuring
* the frequency distance between the measured spectral peaks and the harmonic frequencies of a proposed fundamental frequency

## 10. To detect the most prominent fundamental frequency in a polyphonic signal we have to
* check all possible fundamental frequencies and choose the one whose harmonics have the biggest weight
