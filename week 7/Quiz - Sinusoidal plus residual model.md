# Sinusoidal plus residual model

## 1. An stochastic signal can be described
* by the laws of probability

## 2. The power spectral density of a signal is computed by
* taking the limit of the square of its amplitude spectrum as the size of the spectrum goes to infinity

## 3. The stochastic model presented in class in obtained by
* approximating the magnitude spectrum of a signal and using random numbers to model the phase spectrum

## 4. In the sinusoidal plus residual model the residual is obtained by
* subtracting the sinusoidal components from the original signal

## 5. The residual component obtained in the sinusoidal plus residual model
* keeps everything that is not modeled by the sinusoidal component of the signal

## 6. The difference between the harmonic plus residual model and the sinusoidal plus residual model is
* that in the harmonic model we restrict the sinusoids to be only the multiples of the fundamental frequency

## 7. The subtraction of the sinusoids of a signal can be performed
* both in the time domain and in the frequency domain

## 8. The stochastic approximation of the residual component will give good results when
* the residual component is close to an stochastic signal

## 9. The harmonic plus stochastic model presented in class
* only works for monophonic signals

## 10. If we compare the harmonic plus stochastic model with the harmonic plus residual model
* the harmonic plus stochastic model results into a more compact and more flexible representation
