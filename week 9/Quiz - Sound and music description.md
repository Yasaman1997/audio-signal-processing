# Sound and music description

## 1. In the context of this class, an audio feature is considered to be
* the result of analysing a fragment of a sound to obtain a useful description of it

## 2. Essentia is a software library including mainly
* algorithms that extract audio features from sounds

## 3. The spectral centroid of a sound indicates
* where the center of mass of the spectrum is

## 4. The energy of an audio frame can be computed from the magnitude spectrum by
* summing over the square of the magnitudes

## 5. The mel frequency cepstral coeficients is a representation of the magnitude spectrum and can be computed by
* taking the cosine transform of the log magnitude spectrum on a nonlinear mel scale of frequency

## 6. A pitch class refers to all the pitches that
* have the same chroma

## 7. K-means is a clustering algorithm that given a set of values and the desired number of clusters
* it returns the mean of each cluster

## 8. The K nearest neighbors classifer algorithm classifies a data sample by
* assigning to it the class that is most frequently represented among the k nearest samples

## 9. For the purposes of sound description, we consider a sound to be
* a set of audio features, each one having a numerical value

## 10. In order to describe music recordings, the audio features to be analyzed
* should be related to musically meaningful concepts
